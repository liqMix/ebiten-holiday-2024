# Theme Brainstorming
### <b>*Left Behind*</b>

## Topic
- Ghost attempting to find their way to the afterlife
- Kid running after school bus
- Space pilot stranded in enemy territory
- Two butts but not the one on the right
- Person escaping zombie infested town
- Last person on Earth rummaging through abandoned city
- Kid at home during Christmas defending his house from burglars

## Integration
- Perhaps a rendering system that fits the theme?
    - Notes
    - Tracks
    - Background
- Storyline?
- Potentially have a character that moves in the background as the player hits notes
- Maybe they can wear headphones like the music is playing through them
